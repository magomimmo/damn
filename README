Third Key Solutions, LLC is pleased to release the Decentralized Arbitration and Mediation Network (DAMN) research and project proposal for public comment.

== The Premise of the Project

We have a global, borderless communication and transaction platform. We have global, borderless money. Why not a global, borderless justice system? An opt-in justice system for commercial transactions. One that serves the community. Designed by the community, for the community. A robust system, that can address simple issues quickly and inexpensively, but can also address complex issues when needed. One that offers options, layers of choices, like who will decide (with options of one person or algorithm, pools of random jurors, pools of experts, collaboration of the parties, a mediation DAO, etc.), how long the decision-making process will take, and whether the dispute and the resolution will be made public or remain private.

For decades, well-funded, sophisticated commercial parties have been using Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods to avoid lengthy, costly, cumbersome local court processes. We can design our own open-source, identity-optional ADR methods and implement them as smart contracts. We can provide an open-source interface to traditional ADR methods, for even more options.

== Our Strategic Vision

* Design a suite of simple dispute resolution smart contracts that can be easily and quickly incorporated into other types of smart contracts
* Bridge smart contracts and traditional commercial/contract law relating to dispute resolution
* Bring the unique capabilities of smart contracts to the broader ADR community
* Expand the scope of ADR smart contracts to include and automate more and more of the mediation, arbitration, resolution and award functions
* Design decentralized, identity-optional decision-making options for dispute resolution

== Feedback Request

We plan to develop an FAQ from the initial round of feedback based upon the most common questions. The proposal will evolve in public on github. If there is sufficient interest and community support we may submit this proposal to theDAO or other crowdfunding platforms.
